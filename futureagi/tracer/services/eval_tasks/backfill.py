"""One-time baseline backfill.

Stamps ``config_hash`` and corrects ``status`` on legacy live ``EvalLogger``
rows so the reconciler's "did the config change?" comparison has a real baseline
("as of migration, every result reflects the current config"). Without it the
first reconcile would either re-run all history (empty != any hash) or suppress
every legitimate re-run.

Built to run as a migration over a multi-million-row table:
- The status pass is a single keyset-paginated sweep (advance by primary key),
  so every row is visited once instead of re-scanning the table per batch.
- The hash pass computes each config's hash once (in Python) and stamps that
  config's rows with a batched server-side UPDATE — no row ids are shipped to
  Python.
- Updates run in bounded batches; under the ``atomic=False`` migration each
  batch auto-commits, so locks/transactions stay small.

Idempotent: the status pass skips rows already on the target status and the
hash pass only touches rows still missing a hash, so re-running it (e.g. right
before cutover, to catch rows the old cron created after the first run) is cheap.
``deleted = false`` is filtered explicitly because raw SQL bypasses the default
manager — soft-deleted rows are never touched.
